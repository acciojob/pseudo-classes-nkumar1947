	<h3>First Paragraph</h3>
	<p class="1">In this article, instead of a grammar tip, we're taking a closer look at a key part of any written text, the paragraph. Paragraphs should be more than just a collection of sentences, but what is the purpose of paragraph structure and how does it impact the paper as a whole?</p>
	<p class="2">Before considering how to structure a paragraph, it is helpful to understand the role that paragraphs play in a manuscript. In the broadest terms, a paragraph presents a complete thought. If a paragraph is written well, its main message can be understood without the need for preceding or following material. Paragraphs that are well designed can help a writer construct an argument in stages and can be thought of as signposts to guide a reader through the argument.</p>
	<p class="3">Taking the time to prepare well-constructed paragraphs that are organized logically within the framework of your paper will be widely appreciated by both your readers and the reviewers. First, it makes your work more accessible. While a poorly-written paragraph can obscure the presented ideas and make it difficult for the reader to follow the author's logic and main points, a well-written paragraph presents the author's ideas in a clear and comprehensive manner. Second, good writing can contribute to the author's credibility in the eyes of the reader. A well-written paragraph can give readers the impression that the author is careful, methodical, and focused, which can make your readers more receptive to the ideas you present.</p>
